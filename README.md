# How to run the tests

The following block at `Tests,py`
```python
TestHelper.run(__file__)
```
will run all tests under the package `./python_helper/api/tests` (and also any package named test anywhere else, whitch is not the case)


So, basically, you can run the tests in your prompt just executing `Tests.py`
```
python Tests.py
```
